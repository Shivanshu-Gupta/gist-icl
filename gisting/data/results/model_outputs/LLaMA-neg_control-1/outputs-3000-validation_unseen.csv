"Instruction: Pick a topic and write 3 paragraphs of 200 words each on it <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Causes of Global Warming
Output: Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today. It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.

The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health.

It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events.
A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming.
When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature.
This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming.
Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.
The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world.
For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions.
In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters.
More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health.
Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming."

"Instruction: Write an argumentative essay on the given topic. <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Advantages of Homeschooling
Output: Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education. It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.

The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility. Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children. Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail. Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster. 

Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents. Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them. This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education. Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.

Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning. Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses. This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling. For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.

In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible. It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer.","Homeschooling is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, and for good reason.
It offers many advantages over traditional schooling, such as increased flexibility, better academic performance, and more time with family.
Flexibility is one of the biggest advantages of homeschooling.
With no required class times, students can set their own schedules and take classes at their own pace.
This flexibility allows them to take on more challenging courses, or to take time to focus on other activities such as sports or extracurricular activities.
Homeschooling also has a positive effect on academic performance.
Without the distractions of a crowded classroom, students can focus on their studies and learn in a more relaxed environment.
Additionally, parents can choose the curriculum that best suits their child, allowing them to tailor the learning experience to their child’s individual needs.
Finally, homeschooling gives students more time with their families.
With no need to travel to a school, students can spend more time with their parents and siblings, as well as take part in family activities.
This can help foster a sense of responsibility and accountability, as well as provide a supportive environment for learning.
Overall, homeschooling offers many advantages over traditional schooling.
It provides flexibility, better academic performance, and more time with family.
It is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason.","Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education.
It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.
The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility.
Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children.
Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail.
Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster.
Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents.
Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them.
This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education.
Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.
Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning.
Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses.
This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling.
For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.
In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible.
It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer."

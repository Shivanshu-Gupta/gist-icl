What's the difference?","In Java, you can compare strings by using the == operator.
The == operator compares two strings and returns true if they are equal.
If they are not equal, then the == operator returns false.","== tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object)..equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically ""equal"").
Objects.equals() checks for null before calling.equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).
Consequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().
You almost always want to use Objects.equals().
In the rare situation where you know you're dealing with interned strings, you can use ==."

After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you. Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore. Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution. When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball. ""What if we thought of the problem this way?"" You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview: ""Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!""",You should be able to figure out how to solve the problem using the algorithm you came up with.,"Your interviewer probably won't fault you for going down the wrong path at first.
They've seen really smart engineers do the same thing.
They understand it's because you only have a partial view of the maze.
They might have let you go down the wrong path for a bit to see if you could keep your thinking organized without help.
But now they want to rush you through the part where you discover the dead end and double back.
Not because they don't believe you can manage it yourself.
But because they want to make sure you have enough time to finish the question.
But here's something they will fault you for: failing to listen to them.
Nobody wants to work with an engineer who doesn't listen.
So when you find yourself in that crucial coding interview moment, when you're torn between holding your train of thought and considering the idea your interviewer is suggesting...remember this: Listening to your interviewer is the most important thing.
Take what they're saying and run with it.
Think of the next steps that follow from what they're saying.
Even if it means completely leaving behind the path you were on.
Trust the route your interviewer is pointing you down.
Because they can see the whole maze."

"Instruction: Extract the method that has been used in the research from the abstract of the paper. Give the exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method. <GIST> Input: We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",The method used in the research is to use end-to-end deep learning.,"We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme.""

I would definitely recommend visiting Barcelona.","There’s nowhere in the world like Barcelona.
From days spent strolling the Gothic Quarter to afternoons at the beach and nights partying ‘til dawn, the city is magnetic.
While tapas and bustling mercados are worth every bit of attention they get in guidebooks, Barcelona’s true crown jewel is the work of Antoni Gaud.

Instruction: Answer the following literature question as accurately as possible based on your knowledge of literature for high school students. <GIST> Input: What does the green light symbolize at the end of the book?,The green light symbolizes hope and renewal.,"The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream.
At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy.
He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him.
His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering.
It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip.
Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love.
This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money.
Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel.
This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular.
Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it.
As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream.
After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."

"Instruction: You are given some reviews for a movie. Each video might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points. <GIST> Input: Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves. Review 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives. Review 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.

"Instruction: Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner. <GIST> Input: Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts. Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:<unk> 2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms.

Each team played each other once in a round-robin format, with the winner of each group advancing to the final round.
The teams were divided into two groups, one for men and one for women.
Each team played each other once in a round-robin format, with the winner of each group advancing to the final round.","Every country except Sweden and Norway has qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and each captain of these eight nations will wear a distinctive OneLove armband – which features a heart containing colors from all backgrounds – during the tournament.
The Netherlands FA, which is spearheading the campaign, chose the colors to represent all heritages, backgrounds, genders and sexual identities; the armband will be worn in Qatar where same-sex relationships are a criminal offense.
Sweden and Norway will participate in the initiative during the upcoming Nations League matches, while England will also wear black armbands during both its UEFA Nations League matches to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
“This is an important message which suits the game of football: on the field everybody is equal and this should be the case in every place in society.
With the OneLove band we express this message,” said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.
“On behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now.
It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.” OneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common – their love of football – and to speak out against any form of discrimination.
As well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.
“Our love of football unites us all.
No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love.
Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,” said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.
“I am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams.
Every single voice counts.” In June, England’s captain Harry"

Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of reputed universities around the world. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in developing countries and countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where the discipline originated. Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media and journalism houses, private sector development consultancy firms, corporate social responsibility (CSR) bodies and research centers.

"Instruction: Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper. <GIST> Input: Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

What can you make using old electronics and other salvageable electronic materials? We have a special judges prize for our favorite Instructable that incorporates or is related to reusing e-waste. Be smart and be safe; note that potentially deadly projects (like Lichtenberg/fractal wood burning machines) will not be allowed to be published or submitted to this contest.","I will make a device that can be used to convert old electronics into electricity.
I will use a circuit board and some wires to connect the components together.
Then, I will connect the wires to a power source and a battery.
Finally, I will connect the battery to the circuit board and the power source.","This power booster recycles a 'dead' battery to power a 1.8 volt red LED light.
It's mainly made from recycled parts.
When a 1.5 volt battery is new it will probably have more than 1.5 volts in it.
As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g.
a red LED) and will be called 'dead'.
But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage.
The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit.
The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.
Here is the required steps: 1- Connect a switch to a battery holder.
A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.
2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.
3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.
4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts) 5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts) 6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.
7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.
8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up."

It also needs to rotate on itself.
Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can.
This will allow the can to rotate on itself.
Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.
Step 2: Nozzel Jets Make a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill.
The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles.
Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.
Step 3: Making a Pressure Vessel Seal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel.
Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic.
Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.
Step 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets Fit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda.
Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.
Step 5: Creating Steam Add a little water into the can though one of the nozzles.
Just add maybe a teaspoon or so.

"Instruction: Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract. <GIST> Input: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.","This paper introduces the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding.

"Instruction: Prove the given statement using your information. <GIST> Input: ""If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.""",True,"To determine if it's true, let's look first at the assumptions.
We are assuming that either x is a positive integer, or that it solves the inequality x+3>4.
Next let's consider the conclusion.
We are concluding that x must satisfy both inequalities x>0 and x>12.
If we look more closely, we see that once we satisfy the second inequality, the first is redundant.
(If x>12, then it must already be larger than zero.)
Now, in order for this statement to be true, we need that if x solves either of the assumptions, then it must solve x>12.
Well, the first assumption is that x is a positive integer, which means that x1, so in this case the conclusion holds.
The second assumption is that x+3>4, or equivalently, that x>1, which means the conclusion holds as well."

Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.
The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.
The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms.
A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.
The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive.
Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.
Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."

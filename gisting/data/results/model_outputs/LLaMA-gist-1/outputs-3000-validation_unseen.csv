"Instruction: How can the following equation be solved? <GIST>  Input: 3x + 4y = 20
Output: The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable. 
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$. 
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$. 
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$. 
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$. 
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y. 
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x.","To solve this equation, first subtract 4y from both sides to get 3x = 20 - 4y.
Then, divide both sides by 3 to get x = (20 - 4y) / 3.
Finally, substitute this value for x in the original equation and solve for y.","The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable.
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$.
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$.
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$.
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$.
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y.
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x."

"Instruction: Pick a topic and write 3 paragraphs of 200 words each on it <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Causes of Global Warming
Output: Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today. It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.

The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health. Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming.","The causes of global warming are many and varied.
The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities are some of the main causes.
Fossil fuels are a major cause of global warming because they release greenhouse gases when they are burned.
Deforestation is another major cause of global warming because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by plants.
Greenhouse gases are also released from human activities such as the production of food and the use of fertilizers.","Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today.

"Instruction: Write an argumentative essay on the given topic. <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Advantages of Homeschooling
Output: Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education. It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.

The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility. Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children. Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail. Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster. 

Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents. Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them. This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education. Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.

Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning. Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses. This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling. For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.

In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible. It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer.","Homeschooling has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional schooling in recent years.
With the rise of online learning and more families seeking autonomy and flexibility in their child’s education, homeschooling is an attractive option.
However, many people are still skeptical of the benefits of homeschooling, believing that students will be isolated and lack the structure and support of a traditional school.
In reality, homeschooling offers many unique advantages that can benefit students of all ages.
One of the major benefits of homeschooling is the ability to tailor the curriculum to the individual student.
With homeschooling, students can learn at their own rate and focus on topics that are of particular interest to them.
This flexibility allows students to explore topics in greater depth and develop a passion for learning.
Homeschooling also allows students to have more control over their learning environment, allowing them to focus on activities that are more engaging and meaningful to them.
Another major benefit of homeschooling is the ability to create a learning environment that is more supportive and nurturing.
Homeschooling allows students to have more one-on-one time with their parents, giving them the opportunity to ask questions and get extra help if needed.
Homeschooling also allows students to have more control over their learning environment, allowing them to focus on activities that are more engaging and meaningful to them.
Finally, homeschooling can provide students with more freedom and autonomy.
Without the need to adhere to a strict school schedule, students can take courses online or travel while still being able to focus on their studies.

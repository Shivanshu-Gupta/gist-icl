Output: The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable. 
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$. 
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$. 
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$. 
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$. 
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y. 
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x.","The equation can be solved by substitution.
If we let x = -2y + 10, then 3(-2y + 10) + 4(-2y + 10) = 20, which simplifies to -8y + 10 = 20, or -8y = 20 - 10 = 10.
Therefore, y = 10/8.","The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable.
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$.

"Instruction: Pick a topic and write 3 paragraphs of 200 words each on it <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Causes of Global Warming
Output: Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today. It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.

The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health. Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming.","The main cause of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities.
Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
This gas traps heat and causes the earth to warm up.
Other human activities such as deforestation, which reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by plants, also contributes to global warming.","Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today.

Output: Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education. It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.

The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility. Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children. Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail. Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster. 

Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents. Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them. This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education. Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.

Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning. Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses. This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling. For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.

In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible. It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer.","Homeschooling is an effective way to provide students with an alternative to traditional schooling.
Homeschooling allows students to have more control over their learning environment, as well as the ability to learn at their own rate and in a manner that suits their learning style.
Homeschooling also gives students the opportunity to explore topics in greater depth, as well as gain valuable life skills such as discipline, accountability, and time management.
Furthermore, homeschooling can help students become more independent, creative, and confident.
Ultimately, homeschooling can provide students with the freedom to learn in a way that best suits their needs, giving them the opportunity to reach their fullest potential.","Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education.

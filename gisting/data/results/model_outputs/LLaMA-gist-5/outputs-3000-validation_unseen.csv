"Instruction: How can the following equation be solved? <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST>  Input: 3x + 4y = 20
Output: The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable. 
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$. 
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$. 
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$. 
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$. 
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y. 
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x.","x = 10, y = 6","The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable.

"Instruction: Pick a topic and write 3 paragraphs of 200 words each on it <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Causes of Global Warming
Output: Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today. It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.

The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health. Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming.","Global warming is caused by the increase of certain gases in our atmosphere that trap heat.
These gases are typically released as a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.
The more of these gases that are present, the more heat they will trap, leading to an increase in global temperatures.
The primary cause of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities.
Greenhouse gases are molecules that can trap heat in the atmosphere, and the more of them that are present, the more heat they will trap.
Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are the primary sources of these gases.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming.
When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature.
This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming.
Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.
The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world.
For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions.
In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters.
More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health.
Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming."

"Instruction: Write an argumentative essay on the given topic. <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST> <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Advantages of Homeschooling
Output: Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education. It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.

The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility. Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children. Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail. Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster. 

Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents. Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them. This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education. Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.

Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning. Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses. This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling. For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.

In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible. It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer.","Homeschooling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more families opting to take their children out of traditional schooling environments and educate them at home.
Homeschooling offers many advantages over traditional schooling, such as increased flexibility, better control over the student’s learning environment, and the ability to tailor the curriculum to the individual student.
One of the major advantages of homeschooling is the flexibility it provides.
Homeschooling allows students to take classes or even complete an entire degree online, allowing them to take classes at their own pace and on their own schedule.
This flexibility is especially beneficial for students who have difficulty keeping up with the traditional schooling environment, as they can take as much time as they need to complete their studies.
Another major advantage of homeschooling is the ability to control the student’s learning environment.
Homeschooling parents have the power to ensure that their children are in a safe and supportive environment, free from distractions and peer pressure.
This can be especially beneficial for students who have difficulty focusing in a classroom setting, as they can take the time they need to understand the material without worrying about socializing with their peers.
Finally, homeschooling allows parents to tailor the curriculum to their child’s individual needs.
Homeschooling parents can choose to use traditional textbooks or online courses, or even create their own curriculum, allowing them to ensure that their child is receiving the best education possible.
This flexibility allows parents to help their children learn in the way that works best for them, giving them the best chance of success.
Overall, homeschooling offers many advantages over traditional schooling, such as increased flexibility, better control over the student’s learning environment, and the ability to tailor the curriculum to the individual student.
Homeschooling is becoming increasingly popular, and with its many advantages, it is easy to see why.","Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education.

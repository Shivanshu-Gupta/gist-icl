No, it's not bad to use ==.

Objects.equals() checks for null before calling.equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",The authors used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the speech recognition system.,"We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme.""

It is also known for its cuisine, which is characterized by its seafood and paella.","There’s nowhere in the world like Barcelona.
From days spent strolling the Gothic Quarter to afternoons at the beach and nights partying ‘til dawn, the city is magnetic.

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy.
He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him.
His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering.
It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip.
Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love.
This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money.
Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel.
This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular.
Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it.
As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream.
After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves. Review 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives. Review 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts. Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:<unk> 2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting","Mathematics and art have a long history of collaboration.

"Instruction: You are given two questions. Check if they are duplicates. <GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST> Input: Question1: I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing? Question2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code. I am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one. Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed. I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on). So, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules? Can you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?",Yes,"Yes, they are duplicates."

You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.
- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.
- Chapter Three: Conditional Code In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.
It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices"".

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. Explain: The dominant sequence transduction models","The Transformer is a neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to perform sequence transduction tasks.

But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage.
The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit.
The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.
Here is the required steps: 1- Connect a switch to a battery holder.
A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.
2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.
3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.
4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts) 5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts) 6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.
7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.
8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up."

Gather the necessary materials, such as an empty beer can, a screwdriver, a drill, and a hammer.
2.
Cut the top off the beer can and drill a hole in the bottom.
3.
Place the screws and drill into the holes in the bottom of the beer can.
4.
Place the hammer into the hole in the bottom of the beer can and drill a hole in the top of the beer can.
5.
Place the hammer into the hole in the top of the beer can and","Step 1: Close Drink Opening To build up steam the beverage can needs to act as a pressure vessel and so needs to be completely sealed, except where the steam will come out of the jet nozzles.
It also needs to rotate on itself.
Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can.
This will allow the can to rotate on itself.
Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.
Step 2: Nozzel Jets Make a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill.
The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles.
Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.
Step 3: Making a Pressure Vessel Seal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel.
Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic.
Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.
Step 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets Fit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda.
Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.
Step 5: Creating Steam Add a little water into the can though one of the nozzles.
Just add maybe a teaspoon or so.

"Instruction: Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract. <GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST> Input: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.","This paper presents a novel approach to improve dialogue understanding in the few-shot setting.

"Instruction: Prove the given statement using your information. <GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST><GIST> Input: ""If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.""",True,"To determine if it's true, let's look first at the assumptions.
We are assuming that either x is a positive integer, or that it solves the inequality x+3>4.
Next let's consider the conclusion.
We are concluding that x must satisfy both inequalities x>0 and x>12.
If we look more closely, we see that once we satisfy the second inequality, the first is redundant.
(If x>12, then it must already be larger than zero.)
Now, in order for this statement to be true, we need that if x solves either of the assumptions, then it must solve x>12.
Well, the first assumption is that x is a positive integer, which means that x1, so in this case the conclusion holds.
The second assumption is that x+3>4, or equivalently, that x>1, which means the conclusion holds as well."

It is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system.
Excess zinc is not harmful as it is excreted in the urine.","Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful.
Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.
The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.
The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms.
A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.
The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive.
Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.
Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."

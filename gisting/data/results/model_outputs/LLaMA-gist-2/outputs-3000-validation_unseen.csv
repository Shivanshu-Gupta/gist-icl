"Instruction: How can the following equation be solved? <GIST> <GIST>  Input: 3x + 4y = 20
Output: The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable. 
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$. 
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$. 
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$. 
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$. 
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y. 
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x.","To solve this equation, we can first subtract 4y from both sides to get 3x = 20 - 4y.
Then we can divide both sides by 3 to get x = (20 - 4y) / 3.
Therefore, the solution is x = (20 - 4y) / 3.","The equation can be solved by isolating one of the variables (x or y), multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient of that variable and then solving for the variable.
For example, to solve for x, we first divide both sides by 4, giving 
$\frac{3x}{4} + y = \frac{20}{4}$.
Then we multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$ to get 
$3x + \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y = \frac{20 \times 4}{3}$.
Finally, we subtract $\frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$ from both sides to get 
$3x = \frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y$.
Then we divide both sides by 3 to get
$x = \frac{\frac{20 \times 4}{3} - \frac{4 \times 4}{3}y}{3}$.
Now we have a linear equation for y, that can be solved for the value of y.
Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation for x to calculate the value of x."

"Instruction: Compare and contrast the features of two different ML algorithms <GIST> <GIST>  Input: K-means clustering and Decision Tree
Output: K-means clustering is a form of unsupervised learning which uses a dataset and finds structures or clusters in it. It works by making clusters with the groups of data that are most similar based on the features of the dataset. Decision trees are used in supervised learning and they build a decision tree by making decisions based on certain features. They work by going through a series of questions until the outcome is defined. Decision trees can be used for classification tasks while K-means clustering is suited for clustering tasks.","K-means clustering is an unsupervised ML algorithm used for clustering data into a given number of clusters, where the mean value of the data in each group is calculated and used to update the clusters.
Decision Tree is a supervised ML algorithm used for classification, where a series of decision nodes are used to split the data into the correct class.
K-means clustering does not require labeled data, while Decision Tree does.
K-means clustering is more efficient in terms of time and memory, while Decision Tree is more flexible and can be used to detect complex nonlinear relationships.","K-means clustering is a form of unsupervised learning which uses a dataset and finds structures or clusters in it.

"Instruction: Pick a topic and write 3 paragraphs of 200 words each on it <GIST> <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Causes of Global Warming
Output: Global warming is an existential threat facing the world today. It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.

The effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health. Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming.","Global warming is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

"Instruction: Write an argumentative essay on the given topic. <GIST> <GIST>  Input: Topic: The Advantages of Homeschooling
Output: Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education. It offers several advantages that make it a viable alternative to traditional school settings, including flexibility, control over curriculum, and personalization of learning.

The first advantage of homeschooling is flexibility. Homeschooling families can pick and choose their own curriculum, allowing parents to choose topics and subjects that align perfectly with the goals they have set for their children. Learning can also be tailored to the individual student’s needs, allowing children to progress at their own pace and explore areas that interest them in detail. Another benefit of flexibility is that classes can be taken in weeks or months instead of years, allowing students to progress faster. 

Another major advantage of homeschooling is the increased level of control it offers parents. Homeschooling parents can decide what topics they want to cover, such as religion or science, and how they want to cover them. This allows them to weave their own values or belief systems into their child’s education. Additionally, the individualized nature of homeschooling means that parents have the freedom to set their own schedule and decide when their children should have a break.

Finally, homeschooling enables personalization of learning. Parents can create an environment tailored to their child’s needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s strengths and weaknesses. This can help children learn more effectively and build up areas where they are struggling. For children who have difficulties like ADHD or dyslexia, homeschooling also offers additional strategies and resources to help them overcome their challenges.

In conclusion, homeschooling can be an incredibly beneficial option for parents who are looking to provide their children with the best education possible. It offers the flexibility, control, and personalization that traditional schools simply can not offer.","Homeschooling has become an increasingly popular form of education in recent years, with an estimated 2.5 million students in the United States alone opting out of traditional schooling.
Homeschooling offers students the opportunity to learn in an environment tailored to their unique learning style, as well as the ability to explore topics and interests in greater depth.
Homeschooling also allows students to have more control over their learning, as well as the flexibility to learn at their own rate.
Furthermore, homeschooling can help foster a sense of independence, responsibility, and accountability that is often lacking in traditional schooling.
Ultimately, homeschooling can provide students with the opportunity to become well-rounded, self-motivated, and successful adults.","Homeschooling is becoming an increasingly popular option for parents who want to provide their children with a quality education.

Output: This guide is designed to help developers create a product that seamlessly integrates both AI and Robotics, while having a visually appealing cartoon theme.

Finally, be sure to consider how the product could be used by different users. This can be done by creating scenarios and prototypes that can be tested. This will help identify problems and provide feedback. 
Testing the product is an important part of the developers’ workflow, as it allows developers to fine-tune their creations before they are released to the public.","The design guide should involve a set of instructions that explain how to design the tech product in a way that is easy to understand.
